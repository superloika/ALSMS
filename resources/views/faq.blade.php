                What curriculum is used in the ALS?
            </div>
            <div class="text-h6">
                The ALS Curriculum reflects the set of knowledge skills and competencies that learners should develop to meet the minimum requirements of basic education. It is comparable to the formal school curriculum. The teaching and learning processes and resources are based on the ALS Curriculum.

            </div>
            <div class="text-h6">
                ALS is intended for out-of-school children, youth and adults who need basic and functional literacy skills, knowledge and values.
These people are usually located in far-flung communities with no or limited access to formal schools.

                Who delivers the ALS?
            </div>
            <div class="text-h6">
                ALS is either DepEd-delivered, DepEd-procured, or DepEd Partners-delivered.

DepEd-delivered refers to the implementation arrangement where program is directly carried-out by DepEd ALS implementers such as the ALS Mobile Teachers and District ALS Coordinators.
DepEd-procured refers to the implementation arrangement where program is contracted by DepEd to service providers such as non-government organizations and other government organizations and literacy volunteers.
DepEd Partners-delivered refers to the implementation of ALS Programs by non-DepEd organizations such as Local Government Units (LGUs), Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) and other Government Organizations (GOs), international donor agencies, church-based organizations and individuals on a voluntary basis using their own resources.

                How does learning intervention take place in the ALS?
            </div>
            <div class="text-h6">
                The learning facilitator (Facilitator, Instructional Manager, ALS Mobile Teacher, District ALS Coordinator) goes to a sitio or barangay with Functional Literacy Test and a set of learning materials to conduct learning sessions until such time that the learners have become literate before going to another sitio or barangay. However, depending on the need of the learners, the learning facilitator goes back to a sitio or barangay for visitation and follow-up.

Most of the time, instead of the learners going to the Community Learning Center, the learning facilitator brings the learning materials to the learners to help them acquire basic and or functional literacy skills.

ALS programs are delivered in various modes such as face-to-face, radio-based, eSkwela/computer-based or independent learning.
